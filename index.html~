      <h3>Typed notes for Moduli of Elliptic Curves</h3>
      <p>
        For those taking Andreas Mihatsch's course on moduli of
        elliptic curves, you can access my in-progress (and still
        mistake-ridden) typed adaptation of the course notes at the link below.
        I hope you will find the typed notes useful, but understand that there
        are likely many substantive errors. They are provided "as is" with
        absolutely no warranty of any kind. I am not responsible for any
        damages arising from the use of these notes. Use them at your own
        risk.
