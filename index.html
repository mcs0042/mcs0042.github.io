        <h4>Typed notes for Dr. Andreas Mihatsch's elliptic curves course</h4>
        <p>I am in the process of typing up some of Andreas Mihatsch's
          notes for his in-progress course on moduli spaces of elliptic curves.
          I am making them available now as a resource for those taking
          the course.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please be aware that <u>there may be substantive errors</u> in the
          typed notes (all errors in the typed notes should be assumed to be
          mine, not Dr.
          Mihatsch's). If you find any errors, substantive or otherwise, I would
          appreciate it if you'd let me know as soon as possible, either by
          sending me an email or opening an issue on the
          <a href="https://github.com/mcs0042/mcs0042.github.io">GitHub page</a>
          for this website.
