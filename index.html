        <p>
          Hi! Welcome to my website. I am a mathematics student.
          If you'd like to send me an email, you can obtain my address by reording the following
          list of strings appropriately: dot uni-bonn at de s6mastev. I'm not active on any social
          media platforms.
        </p>

        <h4>Things I've worked on</h4>
        <p> <a href="bachelor.pdf">Real-rootedness Conjectures in Matroid Theory.</a> My bachelor's thesis, in which I write about two conjectures in matroid theory—that the
        Hilbert series of matroid Chow rings and augmented Chow rings are real-rooted—and address special
        cases of these and a third related conjecture. This project was proposed by June Huh, who had suspected that real-rootedness might hold no earlier than 2019, and was co-advised by Huh and Ravi Vakil.</p>
